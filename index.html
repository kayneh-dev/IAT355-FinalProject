            <h2>An Industry Moving Into the Mainstream</h2>
            <p>Sports betting has shifted from a niche activity to a mainstream feature of American sports culture. Fans no longer just watch games, they place wagers through mobile apps, track odds in real time, and see betting promotions during live broadcasts. This rapid growth has been driven by changes in U.S. law, aggressive marketing from sportsbooks, and the convenience of online platforms. At the same time, it has raised serious questions about regulation and who really benefits financially. Let's explores how sports betting became legal, how popular it has become, which platforms dominate the market, and what risks are hidden behind the excitement.</p>
            

            <h2>How Sports Betting Became Legal in the United States</h2>
                <figure class="history-quote">
                    <blockquote>
                        “The legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make. Congress can regulate sports gambling directly, but if it elects not to do so, each state is free to act on its own. Our job is to interpret the law Congress has enacted and decide whether it is consistent with the Constitution. PASPA is not. PASPA “regulate[s] state governments' regulation” of their citizens. The Constitution gives Congress no such power. The judgment of the Third Circuit is reversed.”
                    </blockquote>

                <h3>Different states, Different regulations</h3>
                <p>Like many industries, going online looks to be the next step in the sports betting world. It allows consumers to place bets on sports in a convenient manner via a website or app. It is ultimately a more accessible way to wager money on sports than the land-based alternatives that bettors must attend in person. But not all states that have legalized sports betting have, or will, allow online or mobile wagering. Some states, like North Carolina, require all bets to be placed inside a casino. Meanwhile, states like New Jersey have legalized both land-based and online wagering. In September 2021, over 90 percent of sports bets in New Jersey were placed online.</p>

            <h2>Is It Really That Popular?</h2>
            <p> Sports betting has steadily grown in public interest over the past two decades, and this trend is clearly reflected in the Google search data visualized above. The blue line shows how often people searched for “sports betting” over time, while the red regression line highlights the long-term direction of this activity. Despite short-term spikes around major sporting events, the upward slope of the regression line suggests a gradual and consistent increase in interest. In other words, people are searching for sports betting more frequently now than in previous years, reflecting broader cultural acceptance, expanding legalization across states, and rising accessibility through online platforms. </p>
            <div id="searchTrendChart"></div>
            <p>Numbers represent search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. A value of 50 means that the term is half as popular. A score of 0 means there was not enough data for this term.</p>

            <h3>Where does the revenue go?</h3>
            <p>In the first 13 months of legalization, the largest cut of revenue was, unsurprisingly, retained by the sports betting operators. However, a few other groups also gain from legalization.</p>
            <p>There are varying state policies regarding the taxing of sports betting, meaning that some states are bringing in more tax revenue than others. With the development of these statespecific regulations and policies, the first year's sum of almost 70 million U.S. dollars looks set to grow in the future.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, the federal government takes 0.25 percent of all sportsbook handles in the U.S., which may not sound like much, but it resulted in a payment of almost 25 million U.S. dollars between June 2018 and July 2019. This figure also stands to grow alongside the market.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the smallest cut went to the operator's tax obligations to cities, counties, horse racing purses, and other community investments.</p>

            <h2>Regulating the 'Sport'</h2>
            <p>When it comes to public opinion on sports betting, it seems that most Americans have sided with the courts. In 2019, the majority of the U.S. public supported the legalization of sports betting in their respective states. Although, as has been previously shown, while sports betting has been met with considerable approval, the legislation is yet to catch up.</p>
            <p>Some of the perks of legalizing sports betting include the following: ▪ Economic benefits ▪ The potential to win money ▪ An added element of excitement when watching sports However, sports betting has not yet gained the full support of the U.S. public. There is still a way to go for the industry to win over the whole of the country, particularly the more conservative states. Some of the concerns of legalizing sports betting include the following: ▪ Match-fixing ▪ Gambling addiction ▪ It shifts the focus away from the sport itself With that in mind, the upcoming pages will expand further on the perception and participation of sports betting in the United States.</p>
