            <h2>Google Search Trend</h2>
            <p> Sports betting has steadily grown in public interest over the past two decades, and this trend is clearly reflected in the Google search data visualized above. The blue line shows how often people searched for “sports betting” over time, while the red regression line highlights the long-term direction of this activity. Despite short-term spikes around major sporting events, the upward slope of the regression line suggests a gradual and consistent increase in interest. In other words, people are searching for sports betting more frequently now than in previous years, reflecting broader cultural acceptance, expanding legalization across states, and rising accessibility through online platforms. </p>

            <p>Numbers represent search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. A value of 50 means that the term is half as popular. A score of 0 means there was not enough data for this term.</p>

                    <p>The Sports Betting Amendment is approved in New Jersey. The measure amends the state constitution to allow the legislature to legalize betting on the results of professional, college, and amateur sporting events. Governor Christie signs the bill on January 17, 2012.</p>

            Blue indicates states where sports betting is fully legal. Red indicates 
            states where sports betting is illegal. Intermediate colors represent 
            partial legalization, such as retail-only or online-only betting.

            <h3>Different states, different regulations</h3>
            <p>Like many industries, going online looks to be the next step in the sports betting world. It allows consumers to place bets on sports in a convenient manner via a website or app. It is ultimately a more accessible way to wager money on sports than the land-based alternatives that bettors must attend in person. But not all states that have legalized sports betting have, or will, allow online or mobile wagering. Some states, like North Carolina, require all bets to be placed inside a casino. Meanwhile, states like New Jersey have legalized both land-based and online wagering. In September 2021, over 90 percent of sports bets in New Jersey were placed online.</p>
